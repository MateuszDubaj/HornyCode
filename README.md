# HornyCode: The Furry Python Language

HornyCode is a **Python 3** variant that **uwu-ifies** your code. If you’re tired of normal Python and want to be part of the weird, furry world, then get ready for a code transformation that’s **horny**, **quirky**, and a little too much for most people to handle. We swap out Python keywords and print statements for **furry slang** like `owo`, `qwq`, and `yip`.

## Installation

So, you wanna get this furry shit running? Fine. Here's how you do it...

First, clone the repository, and then install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HornyCode.git
cd HornyCode
pip install .
```

If you can’t handle that basic setup, maybe you shouldn’t even be using this. Figure it out.

## Features

Here’s what you get with this messed-up Python variant:

- **Furry Syntax**: If you hate normal Python, you'll love how **horny and weird** this gets.
- **Output Transfurmation**: Printed output is **uwu-ified**, filled with stutters, and sounds like something out of a furry ERP session. 
- **.hpy Compiler**: Turn your **horrible** `.hpy` code into standard Python 3 if you ever need to clean up after yourself.
- **Python-to-Horny Converter**: Want to reverse the emotional damage? Convert `.py` back to `.hpy` and make your code even worse, you weirdo.
- **Stuttering**: Random stuttering is added to the output. Don’t ask me why.

## Usage

Now you’re ready to start ruining your life. Here’s how to use HornyCode.

### 1. Run HornyCode (`.hpy` file)

You want to execute your **degenerate furry code**? Use this:

```bash
hornyrun <script.hpy>
```

Enjoy the weirdest Python experience of your life. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

### 2. Compile `.hpy` to `.py`

You somehow want to clean up your mess and go back to **normal Python**? Fine, here’s how you do it:

```bash
hornycompile <source.hpy> <output.py>
```

This will take your **atrocious** `.hpy` code and convert it into standard Python 3, because somehow, you might need it.

### 3. Convert `.py` to `.hpy`

You want to **ruin** your `.py` code and turn it into something more **insane**? Here’s how:

```bash
dehornify <source.py> <output.hpy>
```

This will convert a **perfectly fine** Python file into **horny, furry nonsense**. Be proud of your bad decisions.

---

## Example

Here’s an example of what you’ll be working with. A **normal Python class** becomes a **degenerate furry shi**:

```python
breed Kitty:
    yiff meow(self):
        yip("hello world")
        yip("i wuv cuddwes~")
        return nah

k = Kitty()
k.meow()
```

Run this, and you’ll get the output:

```
hewwo wowwd ~nya
i wuv cuddwes~ ~nya
```

How does that feel? Kinda **cringy**, but at least you’re having fun.

## Chat

Got something to complain about or wanna show off your **cringe code**? Open an issue or pull request. We don't really care, but we’ll listen, I guess.

### Notes

- **Disclaimer**: This package is designed for fun, **but** if you're a **closeted furry**, then **DO NOT** use it while your mommy is around or if you're in a public space. Seriously. Don’t make a fool of yourself, fuckass.
- This isn’t for serious development. If you’re using this for anything other than **ironic fun**, please get a fucking life. **Normal Python is waiting for you**. 
- Don’t come here complaining if your coworkers judge you. You asked for this. Own it.

---

There you go. You’re probably gonna regret this, but it’s your choice. **Go ruin some Python code**.
